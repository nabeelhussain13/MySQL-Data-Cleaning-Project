# MySQL-Data-Cleaning-Project
**A Data Cleaning Project | MySQL | Company Layoffs**

This project focuses on cleaning a dataset of layoffs across various companies to ensure it is suitable for analysis. Inspired by the work of Alex Freberg, this project demonstrates essential data cleaning steps using MySQL to prepare the dataset for meaningful insights. The dataset includes details such as company name, location, industry, number of employees laid off, and other relevant information.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

### company: The name of the company where the layoffs occurred.
### location: The location of the company.
### industry: The industry sector to which the company belongs.
### total_laid_off: The total number of employees laid off.
### percentage_laid_off: The percentage of the workforce laid off.
### date: The date when the layoffs were announced.
### stage: The funding stage of the company (e.g., Post-IPO, Series B).
### country: The country where the company is located.
### funds_raised_millions: The total funds raised by the company in millions of dollars.

## Data Cleaning Steps
To clean the dataset, the following four operations were performed:

### 1. Removal of Duplicate Values:
Duplicate records were identified and removed to ensure each entry in the dataset is unique.

### 2. Standardizing the Data:
Data was standardized to maintain consistency. For instance, dates were formatted uniformly, and text fields such as company names and locations were standardized to a consistent format.

### 3. Treatment of Null and Blank Values:
Missing or blank values were addressed.

### 4. Removal of Unnecessary Columns:
Columns that were not relevant for the analysis were removed to simplify the dataset and focus on the key variables.
